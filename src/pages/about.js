    <h1>About Petra</h1>
    <h2>She's a nerd. Ask her anything.</h2>
    <p>Born and raised in Jackson Heights, Queens, to a family of Thai immigrants (hence the fun last name), I was taught to work hard and keep out of trouble. I listened to the wisdom of my parents, but I also learned to live a little more dangerously and a lot more passionately.</p>
    <br></br>
    <p>The dangerous:</p>
    <p>I ride a 200cc Aprilia Scarabeo across the boroughs.</p>
    <br></br>
    <p>The passionate:</p>
    <p>I gambled with my future and studied Latin and Greek in college, just cuz.</p>
    <p>I dance numerous dance styles. I dance with my whole soul and share that with others within the dance and also through organizing dance events.</p>
    <p>I've had multiple careers, ranging from teacher to non-profit development. Now, I'm pursuing software development. But my favorite job so far has been selling plants at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden shop.</p>
    <br></br>
    <p>I love meeting and learning from people. Dance has transformed me into a much more open and accepting human. Because of it, I've met a lot of generous folks who have introduced and given me opportunities of all kinds, like editing a natural wine newsletter, NYC backyard grilling, food co-op-ing, Latin tutoring, coding; and I feel very fortunate and grateful.</p>
